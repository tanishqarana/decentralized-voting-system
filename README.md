# 🗳️ Decentralized Voting System

This project is a simple decentralized voting application built using
Solidity, Hardhat, React, and Ethers.js.

## Features
- Users can connect their MetaMask wallet
- Admin (contract owner) can add candidates
- Users can vote only once
- Votes are stored on the blockchain
- Transparent and tamper-proof voting

## Tech Stack
- Solidity (Smart Contracts)
- Hardhat (Development & Testing)
- React + Vite (Frontend)
- Ethers.js (Blockchain interaction)
- MetaMask

## How it works
1. Smart contract is deployed using Hardhat
2. Frontend connects to contract using Ethers.js
3. Users interact via MetaMask
4. All votes are stored on-chain

## Note
This project currently works on a local Hardhat network for demonstration
and academic purposes.
